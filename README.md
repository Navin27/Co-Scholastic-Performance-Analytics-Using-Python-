# Co-Scholastic-Performance-Analytics(Using-Python)
This is the sample code of analytics .I have done this analytics during my internship period.
Here i used the PCA algorithim to the reduce dimensionality of 9 featues data into 2 features.
I have used K-means algorithim and GMM from Scikit learn pacakage.
For finding the no of element i.e  how many optimal number of cluster should be there. I used BIC algorithim to finding the no of cluster elments.
I tried to cluster the data.
